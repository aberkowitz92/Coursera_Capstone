I put this data into a pandas dataframe and manipulated it until I had the zip code and name(s) of the corresponding neighborhood(s). I had installed \"uszipcode\" database to find the latitude and longitude coordinates of each zip code and neighborhood. I created a for loop to iterate through the pandas dataframe zip code and find the longitude and latitude, and merged both dataframes by zip code. I then created a map to show the neighborhoods in Philadelphia using the latitude and longitude coordinates.\n\nNow that I have the zip codes, neighborhood names, latitude, and longitude values, I was ready to use the FourSquare API to get the venues in the area. I created the request to retrieve all venue categories because I assumed there could be multiple categories to host concerts. After I ran the request for all the neighborhoods, it turns out I was right. I looked through the venue categories that were returned and determined that Concert Hall, Event Space, Music Venue, Performing Arts Venue, Other Nighlife, and Jazz Club could be the categories that would host concerts. Once I had those venue categories, I created a new dataframe that contained only those categories and their location data. From here I grouped them by neighborhood to show how many were in each neighborhood.\n\nLastly, I added the zip code to this grouped dataframe, sorted descending to show the 3 neighborhoods with the most venues and created a map to show where they are in Philadelphia.",
